# Cube4Life

This project has no real purpose its just a project that was made for fun.
Also I wanted to try out working with `Vulkan` so there is that.

`Clang 18.1.3` is used in this project.

`cmkr` is a strongly advised tool to use when using the project.

## Vulkan
You will need to install the `Vulkan` SDK and `GLFW` for this project to be able to build.

### Linux
If you are on **Linux** its very simple just need to install a few dependencies:
- `apt-get install vulkan-sdk`
- `apt-get install libglfw3-dev`

### Other
If you are using lets say **Windows** or god please forbid **Mac** then you will have other problems then getting `Vulkan` on your computer.
